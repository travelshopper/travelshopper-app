## Travel Shopper

Let's the travellers help you to do the shopping

## Contributions

We love your contributions but we have some rules to ensure the collaboration is a happy process.

### Branching Policy

Other than main branches such as `master`, `staging`, `development`, we use some simple namespaces to keep other kind of branches neat.

1. `feature/your-branch-name` for new feature
2. `bugfix/your-branch-name` for fixing bug
3. `hotfix/your-branch-name` for hot fixing bug
4. `fix/your-branch-name` for fixing anything other than bug. e.g. UI, typo
5. `doc/your-branch-name` for documentation
